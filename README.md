# Student-performance-prediction

Analyzing student performance is essential for both educators and policymakers to make informed decisions and take appropriate actions that enhance students' academic success
By examining various factors that impact student performance, such as socioeconomic status, teacher quality, and school resources, stakeholders can identify gaps in the education system and implement evidence-based strategies to address them. Analyzing student performance also allows for early identification of struggling students, providing an opportunity for timely interventions that can prevent them from falling behind

To understand and predict the factors that influence student performance, i tested two different models: a linear regression and an XGBoost. After testing both the Linear Regression and XGBoost models, it was found that the Linear Regression model performed better in predicting student performance. The Linear Regression model had a lower mean squared error and higher R-squared value compared to the XGBoost model.
